        <p id="sanjiBody">Sanji, born as Vinsmoke Sanji, and also known as "Black Leg Sanji", is one of the main characters of the One Piece anime/manga series.

          He is a pirate and the chef of the Straw Hat Pirates. He is the fifth member of the crew and the fourth to join.
          
          He is the third son of the Vinsmoke Family, but he later renounced his title and disowned his family twice after leaving Germa 13 years ago and after Big Mom's treachery toward the Vinsmoke Family. Since he was born at North Blue, Germa Kingdom, he is the first Straw Hat not to originate from East Blue. His dream is to find the rumored All Blue, which is where East Blue, West Blue, North Blue, and South Blue meet along with their wildlife, a chef's paradise.</p>
