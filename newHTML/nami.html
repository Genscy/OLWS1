        <p id="namiBody">Nami, also known as "Cat Burglar" Nami, is one of the main characters in the anime and manga One Piece. She and Nico Robin are the only female members of the Straw Hats so far and is considered to be the main heroine of the series.

          Her bounty was 16,000,000 Berries after she defeated Kalifa and declared war against the world government. Her second bounty is 66,000,000 Berries after the events in Dressrosa. She along with Luffy, Chopper, Brook, Pedro and Carrot went to retrieve Sanji from his arranged wedding with Big Mom's daughter Charlotte Pudding (later revealed to be a trap to have Sanji and the Vinsmoke Family killed by Big Mom). After they retrieved Sanji and saved his family from Big Mom, she and the others escaped Totto land, and the crew and headed to Wano Country. Her current bounty is 366,000,000 berries after defeating Ulti.</p>
