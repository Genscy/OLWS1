        <p id="tonyName">Tony Chopper</p>
        <p id="tonyBody">Chopper is na√Øve and extremely timid towards unfamiliar humans, often acting like a child because he does not know any better. Like Luffy and Aika, he is easily impressed at things like beams, cannons and hidden abilities. He is a coward at times like Usopp and Nami, although his cowardice can be attributed to his childishness and overall lack of trust in his own fighting skills (a contrast to Nami's self-survival based cowardice and Usopp's insecurity based cowardice). Chopper is more or less on a journey to define himself, seeing almost anyone on his team as a role model and in some cases, imitate their behavior, especially Usopp.</p>
