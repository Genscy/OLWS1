        <p id="usoppName">Go D. Usopp</p>
        <p id="usoppBody">A rather boastful seventeen/nineteen year-old who likes to tell tall tales, Usopp serves as the crew's sharpshooter and as the repairman for the Going Merry before its demise. He's the son of Yasopp, a sharpshooter serving under Shanks, and comes from the East Blue. He becomes the third of Monkey D. Luffy's recruits after the latter protects his hometown Syrup Village from Kuro. At first a cowardly liar with self-esteem issues, Usopp grows to be a dependable part of the crew. He specializes in the use of a slingshot called the Galaxy Slingshot which he later replaces with the Kabuto during Enies Lobby and the Black Kabuto after the Time Skip. These slingshots, coupled with his talent in tricking enemies and his absurd sniping skills, make him a redoubtable sniper able to intervene at a very long range.</p>
